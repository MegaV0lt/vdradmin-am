								<dt>Number of channels to use:</dt>
								<dd>VDRAdmin will load the given number of channels from VDR and present only those in any fields where channels can be selected. This also limits the EPG information VDRAdmin will read so that you can use this to reduce VDRAdmin's memory consumption and increase its performance. <b>0</b> turns this feature off and VDRAdmin will use all available channels. <u>Note:</u> Changes are not populated immediately. You have to either wait until VDRAdmin reconnects to VDR to update its EPG information or force this update manually in the "AutoTimer" menu or restart VDRAdmin.</dd>
								<dt>Local net (no login required):</dt>
								<dd>Here you can specify an IP address or range that can login without providing login information. For example: "192.168.0.0/24" will include any IP starting with "192.168.0", "192.168.0.123/32" will only match "192.168.0.123".</dd>

								<dt>Priority:</dt>
								<dd>An integer in the range <b>0...99</b>, defining the <b>priority</b> of this timer and of recordings created by this timer. <b>0</b> represents the lowest value, <b>99</b> the highest. The priority is used to decide which timer shall be started in case there are two or more timers with the exact same <b>start</b> time. The first timer in the list with the highest priority will be used.<br /><br />This value is also stored with the recording and is later used to decide which recording to remove from disk in order to free space for a new recording. If the disk runs full and a new recording needs more space, an existing recording with the lowest priority (and which has exceeded its guaranteed <b>lifetime</b>) will be removed.<br /><br />If all available DVB cards are currently occupied, a timer with a higher priority will interrupt the timer with the lowest priority in order to start recording.</dd>
								<dt>Lifetime:</dt>
								<dd>The <b>guaranteed</b> lifetime (in days) of a recording created by this timer. <b>0</b> means that this recording may be automatically deleted at any time by a new recording with higher priority. <b>99</b> means that this recording will never be automatically deleted. Any number in the range <b>1...98</b> means that this recording may not be automatically deleted in favour of a new recording, until the given number of days since the <b>start</b> time of the recording has passed by.</dd>

								<dt>Lifetime:</dt>
								<dt>Time Margin at Start:</dt>
								<dd>The number of minutes VDRAdmin subtracts from the broadcasts start time found in the EPG. This value is used for timers programmed by AutoTimer and timers manually programmed when pressing "Record" in any EPG view.</dd>
								<dt>Time Margin at Stop:</dt>

								<dt>Life Streaming:</dt>
								<dd>Enable or disable Life Streaming using the <a href="http://www.magoa.net/linux/">streamdev plugin</a>. You also have to set the correct "HTTP Port for Streamdev" below.</dd>
								<dt>HTTP Port of Streamdev (also possible 3000/ts):</dt>
								<dd>Here you have to set the port number your VDR's streamdev-server listens for connections. Additionally you can also provide the stream type you like to use.</dd>
								<dt>Recordings Streaming:</dt>
								<dd>Enable or disable Recordings Streaming.<br />Well actually this is no real "streaming", but you have to setup your workstation so that it can access VDR's recordings. You can use for example Samba or NFS for this. VDRAdmin simply generates a playlist that contains all parts of the recording and sends this to your browser. If your browser and media player are configured correctly you will see the recording on your workstation's display.</dd>
								<dt>Path to VDR Recordings on your workstation:</dt>
								<dd>This is the path where your workstation can access VDR's recordings. This depends on your VDR and workstation setup, for example "\\vdr\videos" or "V:\" (on Windows) or "/mnt/videos" (on Linux).</dd>

								<dt>Read EPG directly using epg.data:</dt>
								<dd>Accessing VDR's EPG through VDR's SVDRPort seems to block VDR for some time. If this option is activated VDRAdmin will read the epg.data file directly so that VDR doesn't get blocked.<br /><br /><u>Note:</u><br />There seems to be a bug somewhere. If you enable this option there's the rare(?) possibility, that some timers can't be programmed due to their summaries. If you experience this bug it would be very helpful if you could send the timer's information to <a href="mailto:mail@andreas.vdr-developer.org">me</a>.</dd>
								<dt>epg.data filename:</dt>

							<dd>Change the number of columns displayed in "What's On Now" with this option.</dt>
							<dt>VFAT:</dt>
							<dd>If you have compiled VDR with the VFAT define you have to enable this option. If this option is set to the wrong value, you may have problems with certain recordings if you want to stream them or run reccmds on them.</dd>

							<p>Use the radio buttons to activate or deactivate the wanted channels in the named menu.</p>
							<p>To add channels to the list of wanted channels you have to select them in the left side selectbox and click "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;". If you want to remove channels from the list of wanted channels you have to select them in the right side selectbox and click "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;".</p>
