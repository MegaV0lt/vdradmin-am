The <strong>guaranteed</strong> lifetime (in days) of a recording created by this timer. <strong>0</strong> means that this recording may be automatically deleted at any time by a new recording with higher priority. <strong>99</strong> means that this recording will never be automatically deleted.

You can use for example Samba or NFS for this. VDRAdmin simply generates a playlist that contains all parts of the recording and sends this to your browser. If your browser and media player are configured correctly you will see the recording on your workstation's display. !%></dd>
						<dt><%! Path to VDR Recordings on your workstation: !%></dt>
