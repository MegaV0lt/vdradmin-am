Q: Setting the language for VDRAdmin does not work. What can I do?
A: There are some things to check:
    - Check if "perl -V:d_setlocale" prints "d_setlocale='define';".
		  If it doesn't contact your Linux distributor.
		- Run: echo -e "LANGUAGE=$LANGUAGE\nLANG=$LANG\nLC_ALL=$LC_ALL"
		  If LANGUAGE *must* be empty so that you can set the language
			in VDRAdmin's configuration menu. If it's not empty VDRAdmin
			will *always* use that language if it supports it or English if
			it doesn't support it.
			LANG and/or LC_ALL are used if you set the language to "System
			default" in VDRAdmin.
